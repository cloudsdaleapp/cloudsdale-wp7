    <description>The Proximity APIs for NFC (Near Field Communication) in the Windows 8 platform are compatible to NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) messages, which are used on NFC tags and to send data between two devices.

While the Proximity APIs include basic support for URIs, they lack support for more in-depth control over the NDEF records, as well as additional standardized record types.

This NDEF Library provides a set of classes that enable you to easily work with NDEF records on top of the Windows Proximity APIs, for use with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8.

Note: this portable class library requires Visual Studio 2012 and NuGet 2.1+. Please update your NuGet package manager version in case the library installation fails ("Tools" -&gt; "Extensions and Updates...").</description>
